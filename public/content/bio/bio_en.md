## Research Focus

I'm working on material development for fluoride-ion batteries (FIBs) and their microstructure analysis. All-solid-state FIBs have attracted great interest as next-generation batteries owing to the high theoretical capacities and high safety compared to the commercial lithium-ion batteries. The major bottleneck for the practical application of FIBs is the requirement of their high operating temperature above 140 °C due to the low F<sup>−</sup> ion conductivity of both electrolytes and electrodes. Therefore, my research focuses on exploring new electrode materials for the lower battery operating temperature and clarifying their charge/discharge mechanism by electron microscopy techniques.
