 <jats:p>Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) enables direct determination of atomic arrangements in materials and devices. However, materials such as battery components are weak for electron beam irradiation, and low electron doses are required to prevent beam-induced damages. Noise removal is thus essential for precise structural analysis of electron-beam-sensitive materials at atomic resolution. Total square variation (TSV) regularization is an algorithm that exhibits high noise removal performance. However, the use of the TSV regularization term leads to significant image blurring and intensity reduction. To address these problems, we here propose a new approach adopting L2 norm regularization based on higher-order total variation. An atomic-resolution STEM image can be approximated as a set of smooth curves represented by quadratic functions. Since the third-degree derivative of any quadratic function is 0, total third-degree variation (TTDV) is suitable for a regularization term. The application of TTDV for denoising the atomic-resolution STEM image of CaF2 observed along the [001] zone axis is shown, where we can clearly see the Ca and F atomic columns without compromising image quality.</jats:p>",null,null,2024/7/2,null,Microscopy,null,null,null,null,eng,null,null,scientific_journal,null,null,10.1093/jmicro/dfae031,"[2050-5698,2050-5701]",null,null,null,FALSE,disclosed

Compared with a BLF single crystal, the microstructure-modified BLF polycrystals by mechanochemical synthesis have improved the F- ion conductivity. However, the funda-mental mechanism of the F- ion conductivity enhancement is still unclear because of the lack of structural and chemical analysis at the atomic level. Here, we investigate the microstructure of the mechanochemically syn-thesized BLF, using atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with electron energy-loss spectroscopy. We find that the La-rich tysonite nano-precipitates are formed in the BLF fluorite matrix.

Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is one of the actively used techniques to directly observe atoms in materials. However, some materials are easily damaged by the electron beam irradiation, and only noisy images are available when we decrease the electron dose to avoid beam damages. Therefore, a denoising process is necessary for precise structural analysis in low-dose STEM. In this study, we propose total variation (TV) denoising algorithm to remove quantum noise in an STEM image. We defined an entropy of STEM image that corresponds to the image contrast to determine a hyperparameter and we found that there is a hyperparameter that maximizes the entropy. We acquired atomic-resolution STEM image of CaF2 viewed along the [001] direction and executed TV denoising. The atomic columns of Ca and F are clearly visualized by the TV denoising, and atomic positions of Ca and F are determined with the error of +/- 1 pm and +/- 4 pm, respectively.",null,Oxford University Press ({OUP}),2022/10/6,null,Microscopy,71,5,302,310,eng,null,null,scientific_journal,null,null,10.1093/jmicro/dfac032,"[2050-5698,2050-5701]",2050-5701,null,null,FALSE,disclosed

Here, by using atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with atomic force microscopy, we investigate the charge states, Li-ion conductivities, atomic and electronic structures at the LLTO Sigma 5 and Sigma 13 GBs. Although the Sigma 5 GB has no significant influence on Li-ion conductivity, the Sigma 13 GB shows the evident reduction of Li-ion conductivity. We further elucidate that the Sigma 13 GB is positively charged by the formation of oxygen vacancies at the GB.

Although LLTO shows a significantly high Li-ion conductivity of 2.2 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) in the bulk, the Li-ion conductivity at the grain boundary is largely reduced to 4.2 x 10(-5) S cm(-1), which prevents the practical application of solid-state Li-ion electrolytes. To solve this problem, the origin of such a low Li-ion conductivity at the grain boundary should be clarified. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the Li-ion conductivity and the geometric structure of the grain boundary in the (Li0.33La0.56)TiO3 polycrystal by using electrochemical strain microscopy in atomic force microscopy combined with electron backscatter diffraction in scanning electron microscopy. The experimental data suggest that the Li-ion conductivity is significantly reduced at the random grain boundaries but not at the coincidence-site-lattice (CSL) grain boundaries. Such a small reduction of the Li-ion conductivity at the CSL grain boundaries may originate from the smaller increment of the activation energy, owing to less composition deviations and less structural distortions at the CSL grain boundaries. These results suggest that it is effective to control the geometries of the grain boundaries for further improvement of the Li-ion conductivity in LLTO.",null,{AIP} Publishing,2020/1/27,null,Applied Physics Letters,116,4,43901,43901,eng,null,null,scientific_journal,null,null,10.1063/1.5141396,0003-6951,1077-3118,null,null,FALSE,disclosed

In this method, however, it is difficult to obtain microstructural information because of the absence of spatial resolution. Here, we show the relationship between the Li-ion mobility and the crystal orientation in Li0.33La0.56TiO3 polycrystalline by electrochemical strain microscopy combined with electron backscatter diffraction. On the experimentally constructed multivariable regression model, we obtained a qualitative Li-ion mobility map of sub-millimeter width with a 100nm spatial resolution, which is impossible to achieve by only atomic force microscopy. The proposed method must be useful for identifying the Li-ion diffusion pathway in three dimensions.
